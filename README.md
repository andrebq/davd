# davd
Barebones WebDAV server to build things on top of it

## Building

Check the Makefile `make build`, it should be self explanatory

## Running

Check the Makefile `make run`, it should be self explanatory

## Docker

Check the makefile `make docker-build` and `make docker-push` (or `make docker-push-daily`),
it should be... self explanatory.
